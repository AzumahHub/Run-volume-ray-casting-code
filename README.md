How to run codes available on Git or GitHub
--------------------------------------------

There are several ways to run code from GitHub; here we will look at two ways you can do this, which include:

•	Opening it directly from the webpage
•	Cloning a repository using the command line or a desktop interface

Opening it directly from the webpage:
--------------------------------------
If you want to run the code in order to see the output from the browser before making a decision to use it, here are two ways of doing it:
1.	We usually clone the repository on our local machine and make the changes, but if you don't want to export the code to your local machine without knowing if it works, you don’t need to clone to your local machine; you can press the greater than symbol (>) on your keyboard, which will then open the repository on an online server as a new webpage in your browser. Here you can make any changes you want, then push the changes to your branch and export the code base.
To open it in the same tab of the browser in which you got the code, you can press the dot (.) on your keyboard.

2.	Navigate to the URL just at github.com and change it to githubbox.com. The project would now be opened in a sandbox, the code would be loaded on the left side, and the output would now be loaded on the right side. So now you can make changes on the left side and verify them on the right side.
With the above process, you can open the code online from your browser rather than cloning it locally.

Cloning a repository using the command line or a desktop interface
To do this, you can use the official GitHub method to download a project, which is by cloning a repository. You may first have to install a GitHub client on your computer; there are clients with nice graphical user interfaces and clients that you control from the command line. In either case, you will need the complete URL of the repository you want to clone. You can get it from the code button by copying the URL in the clone under the HTTPs.
Command line:
In the command line interface, first navigate to the folder where you want your clone of the repository, then type the command git clone, paste the URL behind it, and hit enter. If all goes well, the cloning process will start.
